A homework assignment for techtalentsouth

## Biggest Change
Use of a findBookByTitle() method in Library.java
This method is private since it is only used internally by the Library class. It is a helper method.

## Misc. changes
### Book.java
Used setBorrowed(boolean) instead of separate methods to return and borrow a book
### Main.java
Added books the secondLibrary.
Renamed some methods to match refactoring from other classes.
